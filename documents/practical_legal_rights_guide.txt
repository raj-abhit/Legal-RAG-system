PRACTICAL LEGAL RIGHTS GUIDE FOR INDIAN CITIZENS
Based on Indian Constitution, BNS 2023, BNSS 2023, BSA 2023, and Special Acts
==============================================================================

This guide explains your legal rights in everyday situations under Indian law.
All references use the latest laws (BNS/BNSS/BSA effective July 1, 2024) with
old law references (IPC/CrPC) where helpful for context.

==============================================================================
SECTION 1: YOUR RIGHTS DURING ARREST
==============================================================================

WHEN CAN POLICE ARREST YOU?
- With a warrant: A Magistrate issues a written arrest warrant based on evidence.
- Without a warrant (BNSS Section 35, old CrPC Section 41): Police can arrest
  without warrant ONLY for cognizable offences (serious crimes like murder,
  robbery, kidnapping). For non-cognizable offences (minor crimes), police
  CANNOT arrest without a warrant — they need Magistrate permission.
- Important: For offences with punishment up to 7 years, police should NOT
  arrest if the person has a fixed address and cooperates. Instead, they should
  issue a Notice of Appearance (BNSS Section 35).
- Police must record reasons for arrest in writing.

WHEN POLICE CANNOT ARREST YOU:
- For non-cognizable offences without a warrant or Magistrate order.
- After sunset and before sunrise (BNSS Section 37) — women cannot be arrested
  between sunset and sunrise EXCEPT in exceptional circumstances AND only by a
  female police officer with prior Magistrate permission.
- Without informing you of the grounds/reasons for arrest.
- Without following due procedure (like producing before Magistrate within 24 hours).
- For bailable offences if you offer to post bail.

YOUR RIGHTS IF YOU ARE ARRESTED:
1. RIGHT TO KNOW THE REASON (Article 22(1) of Constitution, BNSS Section 36):
   Police MUST tell you WHY you are being arrested. Ask: "What is the charge?"

2. RIGHT TO INFORM SOMEONE (BNSS Section 36(1)(b)):
   You have the right to inform a family member, friend, or any person of your
   choice about your arrest. Police must allow you to make this call.

3. RIGHT TO A LAWYER (Article 22(1) of Constitution, BNSS Section 36):
   You have the right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of
   your choice. If you cannot afford one, the state must provide free legal aid
   under Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987.

4. RIGHT TO BE PRODUCED BEFORE MAGISTRATE WITHIN 24 HOURS (Article 22(2),
   BNSS Section 58):
   Police cannot keep you in custody beyond 24 hours without a Magistrate's
   order. Travel time to court is excluded from this 24-hour period.

5. RIGHT AGAINST SELF-INCRIMINATION (Article 20(3) of Constitution):
   You cannot be forced to make a confession or give testimony against yourself.
   Any confession made to a police officer is NOT admissible in court (BSA
   Section 23, old Evidence Act Section 25).

6. RIGHT TO BAIL:
   - Bailable offences: Bail is a RIGHT. Police must grant bail at the station
     itself if you can furnish surety (BNSS Section 478).
   - Non-bailable offences: Bail is at the court's discretion. You apply to the
     Magistrate.
   - Default bail (BNSS Section 187): If police do not file chargesheet within
     60 days (for offences up to 3 years punishment) or 90 days (for more
     serious offences), you are ENTITLED to bail as a matter of right.

7. RIGHT TO MEDICAL EXAMINATION (BNSS Section 51):
   You have the right to be medically examined at the time of arrest. This
   protects against custodial torture claims.

8. RIGHT AGAINST TORTURE AND INHUMAN TREATMENT (Article 21):
   Police cannot use torture, third-degree methods, or any inhumane treatment.
   Custodial violence is a criminal offence. If tortured, you can file a
   complaint with the National/State Human Rights Commission.

9. RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT (BSA Section 23):
   While you must give your name and address, you are NOT obliged to answer
   questions that may incriminate you.

WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE ARRESTED — STEP BY STEP:
Step 1: Stay calm. Do not resist arrest — resisting is itself an offence.
Step 2: Ask the police officer WHY you are being arrested and under what section.
Step 3: Immediately ask to call a family member or lawyer.
Step 4: Do NOT sign any blank papers or make any statement to police.
Step 5: Note the officer's name and badge number.
Step 6: Request a copy of the arrest memo — police must prepare one (BNSS Section 36).
Step 7: Insist on being produced before a Magistrate within 24 hours.
Step 8: If it is a bailable offence, ask for bail at the police station itself.
Step 9: If mistreated, note details and file a complaint with NHRC/SHRC later.

==============================================================================
SECTION 2: YOUR RIGHTS DURING POLICE ENCOUNTERS
==============================================================================

CAN POLICE STOP AND QUESTION YOU?

- For general inquiry, you are NOT obligated to go to the police station.
  If police need your statement, they should come to you (BNSS Section 180).
- Women CANNOT be called to a police station for questioning. Their statements
  must be recorded at their residence (BNSS Section 180(3)).

CAN POLICE SEARCH YOUR HOME?
- Generally requires a search warrant from a Magistrate.
- Police can search without warrant ONLY if there is reason to believe delay
  would cause evidence to be destroyed (BNSS Sections 94, 185).
- Search must be conducted in presence of two independent witnesses from the
  locality (BNSS Section 185(4)).
- Women's spaces can ONLY be searched by a female officer.

  intercept communications, and only with proper authorization.
- If police forcefully check your phone, it may violate your Right to Privacy
  (Article 21 — confirmed in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India, 2017).

CAN POLICE USE FORCE?
- Police can use only reasonable and minimum force necessary.
- Use of excessive force is an offence.
- If police use excessive force, you can file a complaint with the Magistrate,
  Police Complaints Authority, or Human Rights Commission.

==============================================================================
SECTION 3: FILING AN FIR (FIRST INFORMATION REPORT)
==============================================================================

WHAT IS AN FIR?
An FIR is the first step in the criminal justice process. It is a written
document prepared by police when they receive information about a cognizable
offence.

YOUR RIGHT TO FILE AN FIR:
- Police MUST register an FIR for cognizable offences (BNSS Section 173).
  They cannot refuse.
- If police refuse, you can:
  1. Send the complaint by registered post to the Superintendent of Police.
  2. Go directly to the Magistrate under BNSS Section 175 — the Magistrate
     can order police to register the FIR.
  3. File a complaint with the State Police Complaints Authority.
- Zero FIR: You can file an FIR at ANY police station regardless of
  jurisdiction (BNSS Section 173(1)). The police station must register it and
  transfer it to the correct jurisdiction.
- E-FIR: Many states allow filing FIRs online for certain offences.
- You MUST receive a free copy of the FIR (BNSS Section 173).

FILING FIR FOR WOMEN:
- A woman's FIR for sexual offences must be recorded by a woman police officer
  or any woman officer (BNSS Section 173(3)).
- Her statement must be recorded at a place of her choice, not necessarily the
  police station.
- Video recording of the statement is mandatory for serious offences.

==============================================================================
SECTION 4: BAIL — YOUR RIGHT TO FREEDOM
==============================================================================

TYPES OF BAIL:
1. Regular Bail: Applied through court when arrested for non-bailable offence.
2. Anticipatory Bail (BNSS Section 482): Before arrest — if you fear arrest,
   you can apply to Sessions Court or High Court for protection. The court may
   grant bail with conditions so you are released immediately upon arrest.
3. Default Bail (BNSS Section 187): Automatic right if chargesheet not filed
   within the prescribed time (60/90 days).
4. Interim Bail: Temporary bail granted while the main bail application is pending.

HOW TO APPLY FOR BAIL:
Step 1: For bailable offences — apply at the police station directly. It is
        your right and police MUST grant it.
Step 2: For non-bailable offences — your lawyer files a bail application in
        the Magistrate's court or Sessions Court.
Step 3: If denied by lower court — appeal to Sessions Court, then High Court.
Step 4: In exceptional cases — approach Supreme Court under Article 136.
