==============================================================================

WHAT IS A LEGAL NOTICE?
A legal notice is a formal written communication sent to a person or
organization informing them of your grievance and intention to take legal
action if the matter is not resolved. Under many Indian laws, sending a legal
notice is MANDATORY before filing a case in court.

WHEN IS A LEGAL NOTICE REQUIRED?
- Cheque bounce: MANDATORY under Negotiable Instruments Act Section 138 —
  notice must be sent within 30 days of cheque return.
- Recovery of money/debt: Recommended before filing a civil suit.
- Consumer complaints: Recommended before approaching consumer forum.
- Breach of contract: Required to establish the other party was given a
  chance to remedy.
- Property disputes: Recommended before filing any property suit.
- Defamation: Recommended before filing a case.

HOW TO SEND A LEGAL NOTICE:
- Send via Registered Post with Acknowledgment Due (RPAD) — this is proof
  of delivery.
- Keep a copy of the notice and the postal receipt.
- You can also send via courier with tracking, but RPAD is legally stronger.
- The recipient typically gets 15 to 30 days to respond.
